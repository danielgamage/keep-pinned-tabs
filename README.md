# Keep Pinned Tabs

Browser extension that suspends pinned tabs and tabs in a 'Favorites' group instead of closing them via `ctrl`+`w` / `cmd`+`w`.

## Known Issues

In certain browsers, the keyboard shortcut will need to be manually bound, which may also cause issues with profiles/incognito windows if the extension is not also installed there.
